This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds. This results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code with the appropriate loop condition.
